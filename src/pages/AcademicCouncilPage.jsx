                            The purpose of an Academic Co-Curricular Committee in conducting activities like quizzes, presentations, Olympiads, science exhibitions, and similar events is to complement classroom learning by fostering critical thinking, creativity, and practical application of knowledge. These activities provide students with opportunities to explore subjects beyond the syllabus, develop essential life skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving, and cultivate a competitive yet collaborative spirit. By engaging in these events, students gain exposure to diverse perspectives, enhance their intellectual curiosity, and build confidence, preparing them for academic and professional challenges in a dynamic world.
